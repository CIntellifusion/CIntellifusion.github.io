<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Bachelor's degree from Renmin University of China, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Jun He from Renmin University of China and Prof. Hongyan Liu from Tsinghua University. During my visit to HKUST, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Qifeng Chen, focusing on video generation. After that, I was an intern at MSRA, working with Dr. Junliang Guo and Tianyu He focusing on video generation and world simulator.

My research interests lie in diffusion models, video generation, and world modeling. I am currently interested in build interactive, real-time, and consistent video generation models that can serve as world simulators.

<!-- <span style="color: red;">I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Spring/Fall 2026.</span>  -->
I am a highly self-motivated student with a deep passion for research and coding. I am eager to work on a series of meaningful projects to advance video generation as a foundation for world simulators.
