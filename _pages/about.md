<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Renmin University of China, working under the supervision of Prof. Jun He (Renmin University) and Prof. Hongyan Liu (Tsinghua University). During my visit to HKUST, I was mentored by Prof. Qifeng Chen.

My research interests include generative models, AI-generated content, video generation, and talking head generation. I also keep up with a wide range of research in AI, having explored papers on topics such as MLLM, diffusion models, PEFT, and RLHF, which I have saved [here](https://awesome-papers-vercel.vercel.app/) and [here](https://github.com/CIntellifusion/Awesome-Papers).

I am actively **seeking PhD opportunities** starting in Fall 2025. If my work aligns with your interests, please feel free to reach out to me. I am highly self-motivated and robust.
