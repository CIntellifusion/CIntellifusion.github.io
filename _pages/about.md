<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-yead undergraduate student at Renmin Unversity of China, supervised by Prof. Jun He from Renmin University of China and Prof. Hongyan Liu from Tsinghua University.

My research interest lies in generative models, AI-generated content, video generation, talking head generation. 

I am seeking PhD opportunities for the fall of 2025.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
