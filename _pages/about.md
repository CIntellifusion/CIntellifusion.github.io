<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-yead undergraduate student at Renmin Unversity of China, supervised by Prof. Jun He from Renmin University of China and Prof. Hongyan Liu from Tsinghua University. During my visit at HKUST, I was supervised by Prof. Qifeng Chen.


My research interest lies in generative models, AI-generated content, video generation, talking head generation. I am also following a wide range research papers in AI. The papers I have read are saved [here](https://awesome-papers-vercel.vercel.app/) and [here](https://github.com/CIntellifusion/Awesome-Papers) inlcuding topics like MLLM, Diffusion Models, PEFT, RLHF etc. 


I am seeking PhD opportunities for the fall of 2025. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me.
